# Cplusplusprogram

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

In this repository, i have included projects two and three. I have also included my simple temp convertor that we wrote as part of this course.
Project Two was a simple python/c++ collaboration which created multiplication tables and doubled an input number
project Three tracked items sold by a grocery and allowed various options throughout
The temp converter simply allowed a user to input a temp which was converted from F -> C

What did you do particularly well?
I like to think that I did a good job of pulling together all of the various items we learned within the term and included quite a few items gleaned from programming reference and tutorial websites.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I think my error catching/testing could be more effective. I did validate some input and made sure that the user choice was valid so that the output would be valid. I also ensure proper defaults would be used in case the error was problematic.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Project Three was an incredibly difficult project to keep track of. I needed to ensure to keep my input, data processing, and output straight between the various selections made by the end users.  


What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I think the most important part of the code I wrote is that refactoring code is terribly important. Being able to ensure code reusability through the use of .h and supplementary files to create additional libraries.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
User comments and supplementary files to break up components of the file made the code more readable. It is important to isolate everything properly to prevent any piece of code from becoming hard to read or update. Shoving everything into the main function is 'workable' but it's a bad idea.
